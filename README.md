## Introduction

`pathgro` takes a brief list of path strings as input and "grows" them into much
larger sets. It is a tool that freely commingles pathname pieces to generate new
omnifarious string mappings. It is designed to maximize attack surface coverage
when testing software components that take pathnames as input; the technique 
referred to as _dirbusting_ as implemented by [dirb](https://dirb.sf.net "DIRB is a Web Content Scanner. It looks for existing and/or hidden Web Objects. It basically works by launching a dictionary based attack against a web server and analyzing the response.")
is a good example of such testing which stands to benefit from path growing abilities.
Such tactics exploit [predictable resource location](http://projects.webappsec.org/w/page/13246953/Predictable%20Resource%20Location "Predictable Resource Location is an attack technique used to uncover hidden web site content and functionality.") and are sometimes referred to as [forced browsing](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Forced_browsing "Forced browsing is an attack where the aim is to enumerate and access resources that are not referenced by the application, but are still accessible.")
`pathgro` has been coded as a set of [GNU Guile](https://gnu.org/software/guile "GNU's programming and extension language") modules that are wrapped in a command-line interface script.

## Examples

General overview of the functionality:

[![PathGro Usage Examples](https://asciinema.org/a/InUx4vKTr0cUYyVYA5jlzVtZi.svg "Terminal Recording Demonstrating Command Line Execution of PathGro Tool")](https://asciinema.org/a/InUx4vKTr0cUYyVYA5jlzVtZi "Various Examples of Growing Path Lists")

Note that `pathgro --Combos 1` and `pathgro --Kperms 1` will generate equivalent lists according to their definitions.

## Dependencies

* **GNU Guile 2.x**

* **NOTE:** you must make sure that you have both of the `guile` and `guild` executables installed.\
Some Linux distributions (e.g. *Debian*) provide `guild` separately from `guile`, so simply\
installing a package named `guile` with APT may not be sufficient.\
(*Debian* provides `guild` in a development package entitled `guile-2.x-dev`)

## Installation

``` shell
# üöä on Linux, install the required GNU Guile binaries
$ sudo apt install guile guile-2.0-dev

# üçª on macOS, install Homebrew according to its site at https://brew.sh 
# üç∫ on Linux, optionally install the Linux version of Homebrew which might maintain a newer version of GNU Guile
$ sudo apt install linuxbrew-wrapper 

# ü•Ç install the GNU Guile package via the default [homebrew/core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core "Default formulae for the missing package manager for macOS") tap 
$ brew install guile 

# üñ•Ô∏è on macOS, you can simply `brew install guile` after installing Homebrew from https://brew.sh
# üíª on Linux, you may need to add `~/.linuxbrew/Cellar/guile/2.x.x/bin` to `PATH`

# üåÄ clone the repository:
$ git clone https://github.com/decal/pathgro

# üìÅ change working directory to pathgro:
$ cd pathgro

# ‚õµ compile the source using the Makefile:
$ make

# ‚úàÔ∏è execute various tests using the Makefile:
$ make test

# #Ô∏è‚É£ install pathgro using the Makefile (probably requires root):
$ sudo make install

# üóÉÔ∏è augment the path that GNU Guile searches for Scheme files when loading
$ export GUILE_LOAD_PATH="$HOME/pathgro"

# ü•ö ensure that the shell process checks for the pathgro runner script in the correct location
$ export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/bin"

# ‚öì append the above environment variable settings to the shell initialization file
$ export PATH="$PATH" GUILE_LOAD_PATH="$GUILE_LOAD_PATH" >> ~/.profile

# üìó read the detailed program usage statement and refer to the table underneath the following screenshot
$ pathgro --help

# üêÖ That's it--you're done! Go get 'em tiger! Grow your pathname lists!
```
